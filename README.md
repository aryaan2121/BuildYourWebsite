# Build Your Website
A small guide on building your own personal website!

## Step 1 - Learn HTML
Create an account on General Assembly and work through the ![Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly) tutorial. All that is needed to build your own site is completing Project 1. Feel free to work on the other projects though!

## Step 2 - Set Up Your GitHub Account
GitHub is a handy way of storing code. It also serves as a great ![version control tool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub), but you don't need to know what that is. We'll be using GitHub to host our website. Create a GitHub account and fork this repository. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

## Step 3 - Set up Github Pages
Navigate to the *Settings* tab of your new repo and scroll down to *GitHub Pages.*

![Settings](https://github.com/mitchpehora/BuildYourWebsite/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202017-09-16%20at%201.10.12%20PM.png?raw=true)

![GitHub Pages](https://github.com/mitchpehora/BuildYourWebsite/blob/master/images/Screen%20Shot%202017-09-16%20at%201.21.54%20PM.png?raw=true)

Under *Source*, select the Master branch, and save your changes. After a few minutes, come back to this section, and the link to view the page will be updated.

## Step 4 - Edit Your Website
In your repo, the code for your website is in the *index.html* file. Open it up and copy and paste a project from Dash into the file. You can add more pages to your website - just make sure the file containing the code for the new page ends in ".html". TO navigate to these other pages, just add the filename to the URL found in the *Settings* page. For example, if you created a new 
*.html* file called *Links*, you can find this page on the web at https://yourGitHubusername.github.io/BuildYourWebsite/links.html.
